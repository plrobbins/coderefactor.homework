# What is website accessibility?
There are many people in the world that are living with a disability. That disability may be a visual disability or neurological disabilty that limits their ability to click a mouse or type on a keyboard. If a website is not designed or coded properly, people with disabilities can not use those websites. This is where website accessibility comes in to help persons with disabilities. **Web Accessibility** means that people disabilities are able to use websites because the website has been disigned in a special way to help for the disabled population. Web accessibility also assits persons without a disability. 

# The Finished Product
When the website is completed, it should look like this:
